As part of the processing an intermediate output is the SSHO data. The SSHO was generated by placing the Bureau One Minute Solar data values into hourly buckets, and calculating the arithmetic mean per hour. Any data gaps of less than 5 hours were linearly interpolated (by individual field, e.g. missing temperature data is treated independently from other fields which may or may not also be missing). Following the 5 hour interpolation, gaps of 24 hours or less are filled by using data from the same time in the previous or next day. Gaps larger than this were ignored and are therefore still present in the SSHO. As a result of this processing, this is a more complete dataset compared to the One Minute Solar data, but with less resolution.<p>The SSHO data available here was processed using the aremi-tmy version 0.1.1.0 tool from the source Bureau One Minute Solar data. Start dates for the Bureau's One Minute Solar data and the period over which stations have made solar observations vary significantly. The first sites began recording solar data in 1993, while the most recently opened sites commenced in 2012. Some stations are now closed. The number of years of data recorded can be accessed by clicking on the station to display the site data."

                "content": "The Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) data is a derivative created by AREMI and based on the Bureau of Meteorology One Minute Solar data. The One Minute Solar data was processed using the aremi-tmy tool, due to be Open Sourced soon at the following URL:<p><a href='https://github.com/NICTA/aremi-tmy/'>https://github.com/NICTA/aremi-tmy/</a><p>As part of the processing an intermediate more complete timeseries output is created, referred to as the Solar Station Historical Observation (SSHO) data, which is also available on AREMI. The SSHO was generated by placing the Bureau One Minute Solar data values into hourly buckets, and calculating the arithmetic mean per hour. Any data gaps of less than 5 hours were linearly interpolated (by individual field, e.g. missing temperature data is treated independently from other fields which may or may not also be missing). Following the 5 hour interpolation, gaps of 24 hours or less are filled by using data from the same time in the previous or next day. Gaps larger than this were ignored and are therefore still present in the SSHO. As a result of this processing, this is a more complete dataset compared to the One Minute Solar data, but with less resolution.<p>After the One Minute Solar data has been processed into the SSHO timeseries, further processing takes place to analyse the separate months of timeseries data to determine the &quot;most typical&quot; months. This analysis is based on the Sandia Method as detailed by S. Wilcox and W. Marion in <a target='_blank' href='http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/43156.pdf'>'Users Manual for TMY3 Data Sets', NREL</a>.<p>In order to generate a TMY for a station it is a requirement that at least one of the calendar months has data from at least 9 different years.<p>The TMY data available here was processed using the aremi-tmy version 0.1.1.0 tool from the source Bureau One Minute Solar data. Start dates for the Bureau's One Minute Solar data and the period over which stations have made solar observations vary significantly. The first sites began recording solar data in 1993, while the most recently opened sites commenced in 2012. Some stations are now closed. The number of years of data recorded can be accessed by clicking on the station to display the site data."

DNV GL then used the mesoscale model outputs to create WAsP Wind Atlas Library (.LIB) files and conduct finer resolution 1 km microscale modelling.<p>DNV GL provided the microscale wind speed map across NSW at a horizontal spatial resolution of 1km in a GIS format able to be manipulated by the Department. The wind speed results were provided at one height, 100 metres, above ground level (AGL) specified by the Department."

The categorisation of wastes has considered the end nature of the wastes to be used in energy production. Therefore, an indication of whether a residue is dry, wet, liquid or woody has been provided where possible. They have been discussed below. </p> <p> Dry and woody feed: For consistency, data has where possible been provided in dry tonnes per annum, taking into consideration the moisture content of residue streams, or left as tonnes per annum where application of a moisture content is not feasible due to the inconsistent nature of the organic waste stream or data. </p> <p> Wet feed: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a measure of the total organic compounds in water by providing an indication of the total oxygen required to fully oxidise those compounds. COD differs from Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in that it considers organic matter than can be chemical oxidised and not just biologically. COD therefore includes more organic compounds (than BOD), and is commonly used for testing industrial wastewaters, a key output from most commercial facilities. COD is also used to predict the potential for biogas production and the COD present in organic material is essentially preserved in the AD end products of methane and digestate residue mass. Hence, where wastewater have been modelled, the residues have been provided in COD tonnes per year. </p> <p> Liquid feed: Compared to wastewater, the main component contributing to the organic strength of sludge and manure is organic Suspended Solids (SS). From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD. When considering biogas production from a slurry, the VS content is more important than TS as it represents the fraction of the solid material that may be transferred to biogas. Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. </p> <p> For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Kelly Wickham at kelly.wickham@sustainability.vic.gov.au. </p> <p> If you have queries about using the data for your project or would like more information about how Sustainability Victoria may be able to assist you, please contact the Investment Facilitation Services team at invest@sustainability.vic.gov.au, +61 3 8626 8746.

Due to the prominent use of Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) datasets across this study, data has been presented at Statistical Area 2 level (SA2),an Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) that is part of  the ABS geographical framework for collection and dissemination of geographically classified statistics. SA2s are general-purpose medium sized areas, representing a community that interacts together socially and economically and generally have a population range of 3,000 to 25,000 persons. They can be linked to LGAs through correspondence tables that ABS provides. </p> <p> The categorisation of wastes has considered the end nature of the wastes to be used in energy production. Therefore, an indication of whether a residue is dry, wet, liquid or woody has been provided where possible. They have been discussed below. </p> <p> Dry and woody feed: For consistency, data has where possible been provided in dry tonnes per annum, taking into consideration the moisture content of residue streams, or left as tonnes per annum where application of a moisture content is not feasible due to the inconsistent nature of the organics waste stream or data. </p> <p> Wet feed: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a measure of the total organic compounds in water  by providing an indication of the total oxygen required to fully oxidise those compounds. COD differs from Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in that it considers organic matter than can be chemical oxidised and not just biologically. COD therefore includes more organic compounds (than BOD), and is commonly used for testing industrial wastewaters, a key output from most commercial facilities. COD is also used to predict the potential for biogas production and the COD present in organic material is essentially preserved in the AD end products of methane and digestate residue mass. Hence, where wastewater have been modelled, the residues have been provided in COD tonnes per year. </p> <p> Liquid feed: Compared to wastewater, the main component contributing to the organic strength of sludge and manure is organic Suspended Solids (SS). From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD. When considering biogas production from a slurry, the VS content is more important than TS as it represents the fraction of the solid material that may be transferred to biogas. Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. </p> <p> The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. </p> <p> For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Kelly Wickham at kelly.wickham@sustainability.vic.gov.au. </p> <p> If you have queries about using the data for your project or would like more information about how Sustainability Victoria may be able to assist you, please contact the Investment Facilitation Services team at invest@sustainability.vic.gov.au, +61 3 8626 8746. </p>",

Due to the prominent use of Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) datasets across this study, data has been presented at Statistical Area 2 level (SA2),an Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) that is part of  the ABS geographical framework for collection and dissemination of geographically classified statistics. SA2s are general-purpose medium sized areas, representing a community that interacts together socially and economically and generally have a population range of 3,000 to 25,000 persons. They can be linked to LGAs through correspondence tables that ABS provides. </p> <p> The categorisation of wastes has considered the end nature of the wastes to be used in energy production. Therefore, an indication of whether a residue is dry, wet, liquid or woody has been provided where possible. They have been discussed below. </p> <p> Dry and woody feed: For consistency, data has where possible been provided in dry tonnes per annum, taking into consideration the moisture content of residue streams, or left as tonnes per annum where application of a moisture content is not feasible due to the inconsistent nature of the organics waste stream or data. </p> <p> Wet feed: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a measure of the total organic compounds in water  by providing an indication of the total oxygen required to fully oxidise those compounds. COD differs from Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in that it considers organic matter than can be chemical oxidised and not just biologically. COD therefore includes more organic compounds (than BOD), and is commonly used for testing industrial wastewaters, a key output from most commercial facilities. COD is also used to predict the potential for biogas production and the COD present in organic material is essentially preserved in the AD end products of methane and digestate residue mass. Hence, where wastewater have been modelled, the residues have been provided in COD tonnes per year. </p> <p> Liquid feed: Compared to wastewater, the main component contributing to the organic strength of sludge and manure is organic Suspended Solids (SS). From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD. When considering biogas production from a slurry, the VS content is more important than TS as it represents the fraction of the solid material that may be transferred to biogas. Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. </p> <p> The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. </p> <p> For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Kelly Wickham at kelly.wickham@sustainability.vic.gov.au. </p> <p> If you have queries about using the data for your project or would like more information about how Sustainability Victoria may be able to assist you, please contact the Investment Facilitation Services team at invest@sustainability.vic.gov.au, +61 3 8626 8746. </p>",

The reason for the later time period used for plantation log supply was the sharp increase in plantation log production over time.Since many sawlogs produced from Victorian forests are processed in other states or exported overseas, the proportion of residues processed in Victoria was estimated from the ratio between total amount of sawn timber produced across the state for the period 2011-15 and the expected total production of sawn timber from plantations and native forests over the same period based on the total number of sawlogs produced and sawn timber recovery rates (Gavran 2014).

Due to the prominent use of Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) datasets across this study, data has been presented at Statistical Area 2 level (SA2),an Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) that is part of  the ABS geographical framework for collection and dissemination of geographically classified statistics. SA2s are general-purpose medium sized areas, representing a community that interacts together socially and economically and generally have a population range of 3,000 to 25,000 persons. They can be linked to LGAs through correspondence tables that ABS provides. </p> <p> The categorisation of wastes has considered the end nature of the wastes to be used in energy production. Therefore, an indication of whether a residue is dry, wet, liquid or woody has been provided where possible. They have been discussed below. </p> <p> Dry and woody feed: For consistency, data has where possible been provided in dry tonnes per annum, taking into consideration the moisture content of residue streams, or left as tonnes per annum where application of a moisture content is not feasible due to the inconsistent nature of the organics waste stream or data. </p> <p> Wet feed: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a measure of the total organic compounds in water  by providing an indication of the total oxygen required to fully oxidise those compounds. COD differs from Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in that it considers organic matter than can be chemical oxidised and not just biologically. COD therefore includes more organic compounds (than BOD), and is commonly used for testing industrial wastewaters, a key output from most commercial facilities. COD is also used to predict the potential for biogas production and the COD present in organic material is essentially preserved in the AD end products of methane and digestate residue mass. Hence, where wastewater have been modelled, the residues have been provided in COD tonnes per year. </p> <p> Liquid feed: Compared to wastewater, the main component contributing to the organic strength of sludge and manure is organic Suspended Solids (SS). From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD. When considering biogas production from a slurry, the VS content is more important than TS as it represents the fraction of the solid material that may be transferred to biogas. Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. </p> <p> The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. </p> <p> For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Kelly Wickham at kelly.wickham@sustainability.vic.gov.au. </p> <p> If you have queries about using the data for your project or would like more information about how Sustainability Victoria may be able to assist you, please contact the Investment Facilitation Services team at invest@sustainability.vic.gov.au, +61 3 8626 8746. </p>",

Due to the prominent use of Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) datasets across this study, data has been presented at Statistical Area 2 level (SA2),an Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) that is part of  the ABS geographical framework for collection and dissemination of geographically classified statistics. SA2s are general-purpose medium sized areas, representing a community that interacts together socially and economically and generally have a population range of 3,000 to 25,000 persons. They can be linked to LGAs through correspondence tables that ABS provides. </p> <p> The categorisation of wastes has considered the end nature of the wastes to be used in energy production. Therefore, an indication of whether a residue is dry, wet, liquid or woody has been provided where possible. They have been discussed below. </p> <p> Dry and woody feed: For consistency, data has where possible been provided in dry tonnes per annum, taking into consideration the moisture content of residue streams, or left as tonnes per annum where application of a moisture content is not feasible due to the inconsistent nature of the organics waste stream or data. </p> <p> Wet feed: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a measure of the total organic compounds in water  by providing an indication of the total oxygen required to fully oxidise those compounds. COD differs from Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in that it considers organic matter than can be chemical oxidised and not just biologically. COD therefore includes more organic compounds (than BOD), and is commonly used for testing industrial wastewaters, a key output from most commercial facilities. COD is also used to predict the potential for biogas production and the COD present in organic material is essentially preserved in the AD end products of methane and digestate residue mass. Hence, where wastewater have been modelled, the residues have been provided in COD tonnes per year. </p> <p> Liquid feed: Compared to wastewater, the main component contributing to the organic strength of sludge and manure is organic Suspended Solids (SS). From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD. When considering biogas production from a slurry, the VS content is more important than TS as it represents the fraction of the solid material that may be transferred to biogas. Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. </p> <p> The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. </p> <p> For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Kelly Wickham at kelly.wickham@sustainability.vic.gov.au. </p> <p> If you have queries about using the data for your project or would like more information about how Sustainability Victoria may be able to assist you, please contact the Investment Facilitation Services team at invest@sustainability.vic.gov.au, +61 3 8626 8746. </p>",

Due to the prominent use of Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) datasets across this study, data has been presented at Statistical Area 2 level (SA2),an Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) that is part of  the ABS geographical framework for collection and dissemination of geographically classified statistics. SA2s are general-purpose medium sized areas, representing a community that interacts together socially and economically and generally have a population range of 3,000 to 25,000 persons. They can be linked to LGAs through correspondence tables that ABS provides. </p> <p> The categorisation of wastes has considered the end nature of the wastes to be used in energy production. Therefore, an indication of whether a residue is dry, wet, liquid or woody has been provided where possible. They have been discussed below. </p> <p> Dry and woody feed: For consistency, data has where possible been provided in dry tonnes per annum, taking into consideration the moisture content of residue streams, or left as tonnes per annum where application of a moisture content is not feasible due to the inconsistent nature of the organics waste stream or data. </p> <p> Wet feed: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a measure of the total organic compounds in water  by providing an indication of the total oxygen required to fully oxidise those compounds. COD differs from Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in that it considers organic matter than can be chemical oxidised and not just biologically. COD therefore includes more organic compounds (than BOD), and is commonly used for testing industrial wastewaters, a key output from most commercial facilities. COD is also used to predict the potential for biogas production and the COD present in organic material is essentially preserved in the AD end products of methane and digestate residue mass. Hence, where wastewater have been modelled, the residues have been provided in COD tonnes per year. </p> <p> Liquid feed: Compared to wastewater, the main component contributing to the organic strength of sludge and manure is organic Suspended Solids (SS). From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD. When considering biogas production from a slurry, the VS content is more important than TS as it represents the fraction of the solid material that may be transferred to biogas. Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. </p> <p> The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. </p> <p> For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Kelly Wickham at kelly.wickham@sustainability.vic.gov.au. </p> <p> If you have queries about using the data for your project or would like more information about how Sustainability Victoria may be able to assist you, please contact the Investment Facilitation Services team at invest@sustainability.vic.gov.au, +61 3 8626 8746. </p>",

Pumped Hydro Energy Storage (PHES) constitutes 97% of electricity storage worldwide because of its low cost.<p>The <a href='http://re100.eng.anu.edu.au/global'>RE100 Group ANU</a> found about 530,000 potentially feasible PHES sites with storage potential of about 22 million Gigawatt-hours (GWh) by using geographic information system (GIS) analysis. This is about one hundred times greater than required to support a 100% global renewable electricity system. Brownfield sites (existing reservoirs, old mining sites) will be included in a future analysis.</p>This information has been developed by the 100% Renewable Energy group from the Research School of Electrical, Energy and Materials Engineering at the Australia National University.  http://re100.eng.anu.edu.au<p>Potential sites for off-river PHES are identified using GIS algorithms with defined search criteria. The surveyed latitude range is up to 60 degrees north and south. Each identified site comprises an upper and lower reservoir pair plus a hypothetical tunnel route between the reservoirs, and includes data such as latitude, longitude, altitude, head, slope, water volume, water area, rock volume, dam wall length, water/rock ratio, energy storage potential and approximate relative cost (categories A-E).</p><p>Wall heights are adjusted for each reservoir in a pair to yield equal water volumes to achieve the targeted energy storage. Energy (= head * usable volume * g * efficiency) and storage-length combinations are provided in Table 1. The approximate number of people that a reservoirs could service for a 100% renewable electricity grid is listed in the third line.</p><style>  table, th, td {    border: 1px solid black;    padding: 5px;    text-align: center;  }</style><center><table>  <tr>    <th>Table 1</th> <th>2 GWh</th> <th>5 GWh</th> <th>15 GWh</th> <th>50 GWh</th> <th>150 GWh</th>  </tr>  <tr>    <th>6 hours</th> <td>✓</td> <td>✓</td> <td>✓</td> <td>✓</td> <td>-</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <th>18 hours</th> <td>-</td> <td>✓</td> <td>✓</td> <td>✓</td> <td>✓</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <th>Millions of people</th> <td>0.1</td> <td>0.25</td> <td>0.75</td> <td>2.5</td> <td>7.5</td>  </tr></table></center><p>Virtually all upper reservoirs are away from rivers, and none intrude on protected area or urban areas listed in the databases that we use below.

The Atlas provides interactive maps of wave and tidal energy resources for Australia’s marine estate, with further available information on supporting infrastructure and spatial constraints in the marine domain. The Atlas compiles output from several projects. Notably the CSIRO led Australian Wave Energy Atlas Project, and the University of Tasmania led Australian Tidal Energy (AUSTEn) project, both supported by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), building on prior CSIRO assessments of Australia's marine energy resources. The Atlas makes it easier to assess the feasibility of potential marine energy projects. The online Atlas has used data from weather mapping, satellites, in-situ measuring stations and a variety of other sources, which have supported development of marine and hydrodynamic modelling applications.</p><p>The online Atlas has 3 main components:<ol><li>Multiple use layers - which contains geographic information on other uses of the marine domain, including supporting, complementary and potentially competing requirements (e.g., Ports, Shipping and Fishing information);</li><li>Wave Energy Resource - includes geographic layers reflecting characteristics of Australia’s wave energy resource, and analysis tools for further data interrogation;</li><li>Tidal Energy Resource - includes geographic layers reflecting characteristics of Australia’s tidal energy resource, and analysis tools for further data interrogation.</li></ol></p><p>The analysis tools of the Australian Marine Energy Atlas provides unique functionality in AREMI. Below are the steps to access and query the Atlas information:<ul><li>Click on 'Analysis Tools' and then scroll down to select a type of analysis;</li><li>Once the type of analysis has been selected, to enable a query, a location needs to be selected; either by clicking on point within the 'Analysis Study Area' highlighted in grey or by typing the exact lat/long;</li><li>Once the location point has been selected, click on 'Run Analysis'; an image with the analysis results will appear in the workbench.</li></ul></p>",
