Data mapped is for the relevant critical peak season (summer or winter) at each Zone Substation. Where a constraint occurs in both seasons, the season with the largest capacity shortfall over the time horizon is mapped.</p><p>This map allows the user to see the progression of load growth relative to distribution zone substation capacity over time, and understand areas of emerging capacity-related constraint. Note that capacity constraints may exist upstream or downstream of the zone substation and as such this map provides an indicative ‘slice’ of the capacity situation through one level of the network. Also note that these images show available capacity before network or non-network options are taken to alleviate constraints, and before load transfer capability between adjacent zones have been taken into account.</p><p>This map does NOT show:</p><ul><li>Areas facing power outage</li><li>The capacity of the network to accept the connection of embedded or distributed generators</li></ul><p>The green and yellow colours indicate a period when zones that have sufficient spare capacity (available capacity is around or above zero), while the orange and red colours (where available capacity is below zero) indicate periods where zones facing capacity-related constraints where investment will be needed to ensure reliability is maintained.</p><p>Polygons shown are approximate Zone Substation service regions. Clicking on a specific region will reveal the details of that location and time period, including the season of constraint and the exact available capacity value for each year.</p><p>When the user clicks on the distribution zone substation region, a range of additional information is shown in a pop up information box. An explanation of the additional information is given below:</p><ul><li><strong>Asset Type:</strong> Type of the network asset. Data presented in this layer is generally only for the Distribution Zone Substation level, although some businesses have smaller distribution feeder regions represented at times. These assets carry the following definitions:</p><ul><li><strong>Distribution Zone Substation (ZS):</strong> Transformation substation typically (but not exclusively) converting voltage to 11kV on the low voltage side, built and operated by distribution network service providers.</li><li><strong>Distribution Feeder (DF):</strong> Medium or high voltage feeder (e.g. 22 kV or 11 kV) emerging from the ZS to distribute power to downstream smaller, local distribution substations.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Network:</strong> Name of the Network Service Provider manages the asset.</li><li><strong>Notes:</strong> Additional information on the asset or investment.</li><li><strong>Constraint Season(s):</strong> Primary season of constraint driving network investment (Summer, Winter, Spring and/or Autumn).</li><li><strong>Average demand growth rate (MVA/yr):</strong> Average demand growth rate for the asset over the 10-year horizon.</li><li><strong>Data Currency:</strong> The most recent update of the shown data.</li><li><strong>Next update:</strong> The expected date and source of the next update to the data.</li></ul><p>The table and chart shows the available capacity at the selected zone over the next ten years in MVA. Where 2025 data is shown for a <em>winter critical</em> asset, this is for the winter occurring in the middle of 2025. Where 2025 data (for example) is shown for a <em>summer critical asset</em>, this is for the summer season bridging 2024/25.</p>"

This annual value can be thought of as an upper bound to the amount that the network could invest in equivalent non-network options (such as demand management or distributed generation) to alleviate a constraint for that year. If less than this upper bound is spent addressing the constraint using non-network options, then overall the cost to network service providers and consumers is lower.</p><p>Annual Deferral Values are indicative estimates which are subject to change as circumstances change, options are developed and more detailed investigation is done. <strong>Annual Deferral Values are not what the Network Service Provider is willing to pay for demand management support.</strong> Refer to the Network Service Provider’s Demand Side Engagement Document for details on how they assess non-network solutions and determine payment levels.</p><p>Areas in white are those with no deferral value. Areas in light yellow and brown are those with limited deferral value where very low cost demand management options may be viable. Annual deferral value increases strongly in the red to purple areas (&gt;$400/kVA/yr).</p><p>Annual deferral value is calculated by determining the annualised value of deferring the network solution (avoided depreciation and interest paid on capital), and dividing this by the amount of network support (in kVA) that would be required in that year to achieve the deferral. Note that while the $/kVA/yr figure shown is a marginal value (i.e. for each kVA of capacity supplied), a whole year’s the demand growth is generally required in network support to enable a successful deferral to be achieved. That is, a sufficiently large quantum of network support is required.</p><p>Note that where 2025 data (for example) is shown for a <em>winter critical</em> asset, this is for the winter occurring in the middle of 2025. Where 2025 data is shown for a <em>summer critical</em> asset, this is for the summer season bridging 2024/25.</p><p>From the investment year onwards the ADV shrinks if load growth is forecast to continue, as the amount of support required continues to increase, but the annualised value of depreciation and cost of capital remain unchanged. As such, the most lucrative time to invest in demand management tends to be the year of proposed investment.</p><p>When the user clicks on the distribution feeder region, a range of additional information is shown in a pop up information box.

However, the peak demand of a network asset generally occurs only a few hours a year and hence it is useful to show the timing and magnitude of the constrained hours on a representative the peak day.</p><p>This map layer shows the load as percentage of asset capacity for each hour of a representative peak day in the lowest level of the network each area with potentially deferrable investment. For example, if the zone substation has deferrable value then the zone exceedance situation is mapped, while if the only deferrable value is at the transmission level, the transmission exceedance situation is mapped.</p><p>A value &lt; 100% represents spare capacity, while a value &gt; 100% represents an exceedance.</p><p>Note that the critical season (summer or winter) and year of investment is different for each constraint area. As such, the peak day data mapped for each area is for the planned investment year* and the relevant peak season. This means that winter peaking zones may be more likely to show exceedance early and late in the day, and summer peaking zones to show value during the middle of the day and afternoon.</p><p>In the additional information (when a polygon is clicked), the values are graphed to show the peak day load trace.</p><p>* If the first year that support is required is after the investment year, then the exceedance for this year is mapped.</p><p>When the user clicks on the distribution feeder region, a range of additional information is shown in a pop up information box. An explanation of the additional information is given below:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Asset type:</strong> Type of network asset according with the following definitions:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Transmission Line:</strong> High voltage power lines (including switching stations) built and operated by the transmission network service provider.</p></li><li><p><strong>Transmission Terminal Station:</strong> High voltage transformation substation built and operated by transmission network service provider.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sub transmission line:</strong> Sub transmission power line connecting transmission station and zone substation assets generally built and operated by distribution network service providers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sub transmission Substation:</strong> Transformation substation at the sub transmission voltage levels built and operated by transmission network service providers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Distribution Zone Substation:</strong> Transformation substation typically (but not exclusively) converting voltage to 11kV on the low voltage side, built and operated by distribution network service providers.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Distribution Feeder (DF):</strong> Medium or high voltage feeder (e.g. 22 kV or 11 kV) emerging from the ZS to distribute power to downstream smaller, local distributions substations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Network:</strong> Name of the Network Service Provider that manages the asset.</p></li><li><p><strong>Notes:</strong> Additional information on the proposed investment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Constraint Season(s):</strong> Primary season of constraint driving network investment (Summer, Winter, Spring and/or Autumn).</p></li><li><p><strong>Average demand growth rate (MVA/yr):</strong> Average demand growth rate for the asset over the 10-year horizon.</p></li><li><p><strong>Proposed investment year:</strong> Financial year when the investment takes place. Where investment takes place over multiple years, this field shows the first year in which the investment takes place.</p></li><li><p><strong>Asset capacity (MVA):</strong> Maximum capacity at which the NSP is comfortable operating the network asset over the coming 10-year period. This may be the secure capacity, the nameplate capacity, or some other customisable level that could change year on year.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mapped year:</strong> Year shown in the map which coincides with the planned year of investment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Maximum capacity exceedance in mapped year (MVA):</strong> Maximum capacity exceedance in the constrained asset expected for the mapped year.</p></li><li><p><strong>MWh exceedance in</strong> <strong>shown year (MWh):</strong> Total forecast energy exceedance in MWh for the mapped year.</p></li></ul><p>NOTE:</p><ul><li><p>The above data is repeated for other constrained assets at higher levels of the network (where data is available)</p></li><li><p>Peak day hourly data supplied is generally raw, unchecked and uncorrected for load transfers that occurred during the period. Anomalies may exist.</p></li><li><p>The peak day date in the graphs for all polygons is shown as “1/1/1900” to ensure it is not confused for data from a specific actual date.</p></li></ul>"

Each NSP can assist proponents to make informed investment decisions by providing more detailed and project-specific capacity and congestion information as part of a connection enquiry. Each NSP encourages interested parties to contact the appropriate Business Development or Connections team by using the contact details listed in the detailed information for each asset. </p><p>Interested parties are also encouraged to refer to the Transmission Annual Planning Report for each NSP, which provides additional information relevant to the development of new generation projects.</p><p>This is a map of ‘Indicative capacity for new generator connections’ determined according to each Network Service Provider’s (NSP) assessment of available capacity. Where possible, NSPs have produced these figures giving regard to the factors normally considered in the first pass connection application assessments.</p><p>Substations and line assets are mapped and consistently colour coded according to their indicative megawatt (MW) capacity for connection.</p><p>The grey tranmission line underlay has been adapted for visual appearance consistency with the maps of 'New generation connection capacity' by Institute of Sustainable Futures (ISF) as part of the 'Network Opportunity' maps. The original dataset was obtained from Geoscience Australia, ©Commonwealth of Australia (Geoscience Australia) 2015. It was adapted in 2017 under the Creative Commons license by the Institute of Sustainable Futures (ISF) at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS).</p><p>A <strong>red to blue colour scale</strong> indicates the connection capacity of that asset where:</p><ul>  <li>Red means there is likely to be little available capacity for new generation without network augmentation.</li>  <li>Blue indicates that there is likely to be relatively unconstrained capacity for new generation.</li></ul><p><strong>Line thickness</strong> is used to show the line voltage:</p><ul>  <li>A thin line indicates a lower voltage line</li>  <li>A thick line indicates a higher voltage line</li></ul><p>It is each left to each individual NSP to determine whether their contribution to this dataset only includes substation elements (points), or also includes powerlines (lines), where powerlines are not presently included for a particular area, they may be included in a later update.</p><p>Where a substation or line asset is grey, no data is available from the NSP on available new generation connection capacity. These are generally not considered prospective areas for new generator connections, and may in some cases be private infrastructure.</p><p>A legend explaining the various colours and thicknesses is displayed in the left hand pane.</p><p>Users should note that indicative new generation capacity estimates have not necessarily considered all technical constraints to which a proposal may be subject. Indications are also subject to change as circumstances change, options are developed and more detailed investigation is done.  Different NSPs use different methods and assess different types of constraints in providing indicative new generation connection capacities and while data suppliers have taken steps towards a consistent approach, the values displayed in one NSP area cannot be assumed to be directly comparable with values in another NSP’s area.</p><p>Capacity constraints may exist upstream or downstream of the mapped asset; depending on the NSP's calculation method this may or may not have been considered in this indicative calculation.</p><p>This map does NOT show the capacity of the network to accept new loads (see 'Available Distribution Capacity' layer for this data).</p><p>When the user clicks on the asset, a range of additional information is shown in a pop up information box. <strong>Many fields of the additional information are optional for an NSP to provide; the user should not expect each NSP layer or each asset to contain all the additional data fields listed.</strong></p><p>An explanation of the additional information is given below:</p><ul>  <li>    <b>Asset name:</b> Full asset name used by the Network Service Provider.  </li>  <li>    <b>Owner:</b> Name of the Network Service Provider manages the asset.  </li>  <li>    <b>Asset Type:</b> Type of the network asset.

It was adapted in 2017 under the Creative Commons license by the Institute of Sustainable Futures (ISF) at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS).</p><p>A <strong>red to blue colour scale</strong> indicates the connection capacity of that asset where:</p><ul>  <li>Red means there is likely to be little available capacity for new generation without network augmentation.</li>  <li>Blue indicates that there is likely to be relatively unconstrained capacity for new generation.</li></ul><p><strong>Line thickness</strong> is used to show the line voltage:</p><ul>  <li>A thin line indicates a lower voltage line</li>  <li>A thick line indicates a higher voltage line</li></ul><p>It is each left to each individual NSP to determine whether their contribution to this dataset only includes substation elements (points), or also includes powerlines (lines), where powerlines are not presently included for a particular area, they may be included in a later update.</p><p>Where a substation or line asset is grey, no data is available from the NSP on available new generation connection capacity. These are generally not considered prospective areas for new generator connections, and may in some cases be private infrastructure.</p><p>A legend explaining the various colours and thicknesses is displayed in the left hand pane.</p><p>Users should note that indicative new generation capacity estimates have not necessarily considered all technical constraints to which a proposal may be subject. Indications are also subject to change as circumstances change, options are developed and more detailed investigation is done.  Different NSPs use different methods and assess different types of constraints in providing indicative new generation connection capacities and while data suppliers have taken steps towards a consistent approach, the values displayed in one NSP area cannot be assumed to be directly comparable with values in another NSP’s area.</p><p>Capacity constraints may exist upstream or downstream of the mapped asset; depending on the NSP's calculation method this may or may not have been considered in this indicative calculation.</p><p>This map does NOT show the capacity of the network to accept new loads (see 'Available Distribution Capacity' layer for this data).</p><p>When the user clicks on the asset, a range of additional information is shown in a pop up information box. <strong>Many fields of the additional information are optional for an NSP to provide; the user should not expect each NSP layer or each asset to contain all the additional data fields listed.</strong></p><p>An explanation of the additional information is given below:</p><ul>  <li>    <b>Asset name:</b> Full asset name used by the Network Service Provider.  </li>  <li>    <b>Owner:</b> Name of the Network Service Provider manages the asset.  </li>  <li>    <b>Asset Type:</b> Type of the network asset.

Where possible, NSPs have produced these figures giving regard to the factors normally considered in the first pass connection application assessments.</p><p>Substations and line assets are mapped and consistently colour coded according to their indicative megawatt (MW) capacity for connection.</p><p>A <strong>red to blue colour scale</strong> indicates the connection capacity of that asset where:</p><ul>  <li>Red means there is likely to be little available capacity for new generation without network augmentation.</li>  <li>Blue indicates that there is likely to be relatively unconstrained capacity for new generation.</li></ul><p><strong>Line thickness</strong> is used to show the line voltage:</p><ul>  <li>A thin line indicates a lower voltage line</li>  <li>A thick line indicates a higher voltage line</li></ul><p>Where a substation or line asset is grey, no data is available from the NSP on available new generation connection capacity. These may in some cases be private infrastructure.</p><p>A legend explaining the various colours and thicknesses is displayed in the left hand pane.</p><p>Users should note that indicative new generation capacity estimates have not necessarily considered all technical constraints to which a proposal may be subject. Indications are also subject to change as circumstances change, options are developed and more detailed investigation is done.  Different NSPs use different methods and assess different types of constraints in providing indicative new generation connection capacities and while data suppliers have taken steps towards a consistent approach, the values displayed in one NSP area cannot be assumed to be directly comparable with values in another NSP’s area.</p><p>Capacity constraints may exist upstream or downstream of the mapped asset; depending on the NSP's calculation method this may or may not have been considered in this indicative calculation.</p><p>This map does NOT show the capacity of the network to accept new loads (see 'Available Distribution Capacity' layer for this data).</p><p>When the user clicks on the asset, a range of additional information is shown in a pop up information box. <strong>Many fields of the additional information are optional for an NSP to provide; the user should not expect each NSP layer or each asset to contain all the additional data fields listed.</strong></p><p>An explanation of the additional information is given below:</p><ul>  <li>    <b>Asset name:</b> Full asset name used by the Network Service Provider.  </li>  <li>    <b>Owner:</b> Name of the Network Service Provider manages the asset.  </li>  <li>    <b>Asset Type:</b> Type of the network asset.
